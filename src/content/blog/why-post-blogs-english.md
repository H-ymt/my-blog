Hi! I&apos;m a Japanese who loves engineering. Here are the reasons why I, as a Japanese, post blogs in English.

## Enhancing English Proficiency

Regularly writing blogs in English is an effective way for engineers to sharpen their English skills. This practice is particularly beneficial for engineers who frequently engage with technical documentation and tutorials, which are predominantly written in English.

## Gaining an International Perspective

Writing blogs in English provides access to a global readership, enabling the sharing of thoughts and ideas on a much larger scale.

## Expanding Networking Opportunities

Blogs written in English have the potential to reach a vast audience worldwide. creating opportunities to connect with engineers from different parts of the globe.
